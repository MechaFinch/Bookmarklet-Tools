# Quizlet Tools

I recently tried to verify that the quizlet tools still work, but there appears to have been a major system change in Quizlet's source, where its QJP is a multi-dimensional array instead of a function and the ids of the functions to overwrite have changed. It is unlikely that I will create new tools for this until school starts where I'll have time and motivation to do so
